# Javascript Scraper
Project using the Puppeteer package to obtain information from web pages.
It contains a couple of scraping functions that I have used for another project.

[soloq_scraper.js](https://github.com/Julianmenav/js-scraper/blob/main/scrap_functions/soloq_scraper.js) function allows me to get a list of all the players in a tournament of a well-known video game. It only has been used once.

[moba_scraper.js](https://github.com/Julianmenav/js-scraper/blob/main/scrap_functions/moba_scraper.js) function allows me to get some recent data about the players in real time.

* [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer): Version 13.7

```
